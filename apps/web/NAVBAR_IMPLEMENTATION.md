# Responsive Navbar Implementation

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Position Issues**

- **Desktop**: User profile (avatar + logout) is now positioned on the right with `flex-shrink-0` to prevent shifting
- **Mobile**: User profile is in the top bar with consistent positioning

### 2. **Mobile-First Design**

- **Mobile Top Bar**: Compact header with logo and user profile
- **Mobile Bottom Navigation**: Floating navigation bar with three main screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: 48px minimum touch targets following accessibility guidelines

### 3. **Responsive Breakpoints**

- **Desktop (md+)**: Traditional horizontal navbar with centered navigation
- **Mobile (<md)**: Split layout with top bar + bottom floating nav

### 4. **Visual Enhancements**

- **Active State Indicators**: Orange highlighting for current page
- **Smooth Transitions**: 200ms transitions for hover states
- **Backdrop Blur**: Glass morphism effect with blur and transparency
- **Safe Area Support**: Bottom padding for devices with notches/home indicators

### 5. **Navigation Structure**

```
Desktop Layout:
[Logo] -------- [Dashboard | Send | Swap] -------- [Avatar + Name] [Logout]
